# SVG Maker
## Description
We were tasked with generating an SVG file using various parameters given to us by the readme file from the class. We needed a logo that was either a circle, triangle, or square, and it had to have 3 characters or less, with a color scale that we could use either a color name or a hexidecimal color code for the generation of the color.
